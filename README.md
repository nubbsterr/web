# web
My new and improved portfolio website written in HTML and CSS (never touching flask ever again.)

# Project Status
I have lots of plans for my new portfolio, the biggest of which is to just write it in very basic HTML and CSS styling--nothing insane, I just wanna be able to host it off GitHub pages, maybe a domain in the future.

Basically, this is the criteria/styling I have in mind:
- Rewrite in basic html and css, js is optional (native JS, no frameworks)
- Monospace font with a mock syntax highlighting kind of text to a degree using bright/vibrant colours; a lot of inspiration from [x0reaxe's website.](x0reaxe.ax)
- A light/dark mode button potentially; this would require JS but very minimal, or just inline <script>? 
- No PII will be linked here; no resume or linkedin
- Embed the github snake svg, same as on my github profile
- Separate page for projects and whatever else we want
- Blog posts/writeups will be done here

I will get going with this soon enough, since I am rather excited and have wanted to do web dev for a bit, not that cybersec needs it, but just to have something I can call my 'home' on the web.
