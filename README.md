# web
My new and improved portfolio website written in HTML and CSS (never touching flask ever again.)

# Project Status
Am still attempting to make the site mobile friendly; not going too well since I really like the 'table' style I have but it totally ruins any sort of flexible (literally) response to viewport sizes, so I might need to ditch it? If you guys got ideas to fixes, please DM me on Discord :)

# Inspiration/Criteria/Checklist
- Use basic HTML and CSS, JS is optional (native JS, no frameworks)
- Monospace font using bright/vibrant colours; a lot of inspiration from [x0reaxe's website.](x0reaxe.ax) (As of May 3, their site is down.)
- More media? dunno
