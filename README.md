# web
My new and improved portfolio website written in HTML and CSS (never touching flask ever again.)

# Project Status
I purchased a domain and have it running very nicely at the moment (from what I can tell, who knows if I'm being hacked rn man.) I also added a lil easter egg in the site for people solve, not that it's hard or anything. I also tried to make the site slightly more mobile friendly but that is to be tested; I won't make this site totoally responsive though.

# Inspiration and Criteria
- Use basic HTML and CSS, JS is optional (native JS, no frameworks)
- Monospace font using bright/vibrant colours; a lot of inspiration from [x0reaxe's website.](x0reaxe.ax)
- Blog posts/writeups will be on the webpage
- More media? dunno
