# web
My new and improved portfolio website written in HTML and CSS (never touching flask ever again.)

# Project Status
First iteration of the website is live! I spent ~6-7 hours just grinding it out and making it look pretty but simple. I'll continue adding to it down the line, but for now, I am mclovin' it indeed.

# Inspiration and Criteria
- Use basic HTML and CSS, JS is optional (native JS, no frameworks)
- Monospace font using bright/vibrant colours; a lot of inspiration from [x0reaxe's website.](x0reaxe.ax)
- Blog posts/writeups will be on the webpage
- More media? dunno
