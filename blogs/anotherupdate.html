			<h2>> another update</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Hello people. To anyone that reads this blog for some reason, I wanted to make a quick update regarding my presence here!</p>
			<p>Previously, I had been posting lab attempts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@0xnubb" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but it's gotten quite 1) tiring to edit 3+ hour long footage and 2) annoying to have to wait months to post said videos. As such, I plan to return to just writing my writeups, most likely here, but maybe on <a href="https://medium.com/@nubb" target="_blank">Medium</a> too.</p>
			<p>I'll start writing them up, and posting them here. Once the season is over, the full writeups will be published. I will only include enumeration stuff and das it lol. Feel free to DM me if you need help on Season 8 boxes though (username is nubbieeee).</p>
            <p>For added context, <code>code/commands used will look like this</code>. Everything will be in one massive line with no crazy syntax highlighting. Not super ideal BUT I hate JS and after doing various web boxes I do not wanna touch that stuff lol.</p>
			<p>K that's all, enjoy the rest of your day :))</p>
