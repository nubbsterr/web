			<h2>> CyberSci Regionals 2025/2025 Review!!</h2>
        <p><i>(11/23/2025), 2 minute read &#x23f0</i></p>
				<p>Yesterday, I was competing at CyberSci Regionals 2025/2026 in Toronto, and it was a BLAST. Even though the WiFi on my lovely Arch ThinkPad wasn't working, and thus required me to drain nearly 8GB of mobile data from my phone, I still had a lot of fun at the event. I'm not gonna say what team we were, since I like privacy, but we did not come last! Our second team was in the top 10, which was absolutely amazing. Nationwide, they were barely in the top 30, and we were in the top 70.</p>
				<p>The competition itself is nothing too crazy. I managed to complete 2 challenges myself, which were both Crypto challenges, and were fairly easy. Most of the challenges at the event were rather silly/esoteric; nothing actually meant to be practical and really test your skills, but rather see how nerdy you can be you know?</p>
				<p>Food was also served and was very yummy. Once hacking was over, there were some sponsor presentations, and I later learned that one of the sponsors was interested in interviewing me, which would happen to be <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/forHome.html" target="_blank">Trend Micro</a>. The rep who spoke with me actually liked my blog (if you're here, then that's cool :D), which was a crazy victory in my eyes. The interview was very fun and chill. I was proposed a chance at doing vulnerability research with Trend Micro, except they realized I was only a first year uni student, and not in a co-op term yet, so that was dropped quickly.</p>
				<p>Even so, I got some LinkedIn contact info from them, which is very nice. I plan to continue doing RE and publish one good blog on some malware research before the end of my second semester to show that yes, I can actually be good at RE.</p>
				<p>With that, I really don't have much else to say. I just had lots of fun and got to speak with some cybersecurity professionals, even one from the CSE, which was super fun. Would absolutely recommend this event to any Canadian cybersecurity enjoyer :)</p>
				<p>Thanks for reading, and have a good rest of your day!</p>
