            <p><i>(04/30/2025), 2 minute read &#x23f0</i></p>

			<p>Hello people. If you already know me, that's cool, but why are you reading this?</p>
			<p>Regardless, hello there &#x1F44B! I go by Nubb, nubbie, nibble, and many other names known by many other people. I am a Grade 12 student who just got back their midterm marks, and am studying cybersecurity in my free time.</p>
			<p style="display: inline">I owe a lot of my success to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@realcrin">crin</a> who has some lovely roadmaps which I 100% recommend to watch over. I also have some awesome friends on Discord; to <p style="color: DeepPink; display: inline;">Chroma</p>, <p style="color: MediumOrchid; display: inline;">Lavender</p> and <p style="color: DodgerBlue; display: inline;">Eurofighter</p>, I owe many thanks to you guys more all the knowledge and support you've given me thus far!</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, I'm studying a good amount of Active Directory and Red Teaming mainly. I want to focus more effort into <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a> so I can actually get gud at blue team xD</p>
			<p>Someday I do plan to take my Security+ exam as well. I've finished studying for it so all that's left for me to do is run practice exams and get >=90%.</p>
			<p>Exam Q: <i>"What is the name of an attack that shuts down some service?"</i></p>
			<p>Me: NON-REPUDIATION! &#128483</p>
			<p>In all seriousness, I'm excited to continue learning cybersecurity. My current employment goal is SOC; preferably internal and not in an MSSP, but we'll see. My real end goal is Red Team Ops in any capacity. Breaking things and seeing funny commands break down Active Directory forests is something I wanna do; legally of course.</p>
			<p>Break's over for me, so it's time to dip. I'll be back in 10 years.</p>
			<p>Thanks for reading :D</p>
